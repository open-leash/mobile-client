## ✨ What this app is

`mobile-client` is the iOS/Android companion app for OpenLeash approvals.

It connects to OpenLeash Cloud or a customer-hosted API, signs existing users in through the configured identity provider, registers the phone, and lets users approve or deny held agent actions.

Mobile is sign-in only. Account creation happens from desktop or web.

---

## 🔥 What it does

- Discovers the selected API and organization
- Starts OAuth/SSO sign-in
- Registers mobile devices
- Shows pending decisions
- Sends allow/deny responses
- Supports approval flows when users are away from the desktop

---

## 🛠 Run locally

Start a local cloud simulation first:

```bash
python3 run.py
```

Choose **OpenLeash Cloud**.

Then:

```bash
cd apps/mobile-client
flutter pub get
flutter run
```

iOS simulator:

```bash
flutter run -d ios \
  --dart-define=OPENLEASH_CLOUD_API_URL=http://localhost:9318 \
  --dart-define=OPENLEASH_DASHBOARD_URL=http://localhost:9302
```

Android emulator:

```bash
flutter run -d android \
  --dart-define=OPENLEASH_CLOUD_API_URL=http://10.0.2.2:9318 \
  --dart-define=OPENLEASH_DASHBOARD_URL=http://10.0.2.2:9302
```

## 🧠 Local API tips

- iOS Simulator can usually reach `http://localhost:9318`.
- Android Emulator may need `http://10.0.2.2:9318`.
- Physical devices need your laptop's LAN IP.
- Real OAuth requires matching provider redirect setup.
- Local dev auth is easiest for quick app testing.

---

## 🎨 UX rule

Approvals should be fast, readable, and hard to misunderstand.

This is not where users debug policy theory. This is where they make a crisp allow/deny decision.
